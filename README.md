# Jenn-Stickee-Pad

this wesite was modified off of starter code to create a note taker appilication for the user to write and save notes and organize their thoughts.

## use

When you press the plus sign it will start a new note. to save the note press the save disk icon. to review a note click on the note you wish to review. if you would like to delete a note close your eyes.

## install

do an npm install with express and node to get started with any back end edits.

## challenges

I had trouble with the delete button. I feel like I tried my best but since it was just a bonus I abandoned it. any suggestions is appreciated.
